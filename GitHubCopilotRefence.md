## Real-World MCP Workflow Example

**Scenario: Implementing Accessibility Compliance**

Your team needs to update a customer portal to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards based on design specs and audit issues.

**MCP Servers Used:**

- GitHub MCP (issue tracking, branch management, PR creation)
- Figma MCP (design specification access)
- Playwright MCP (automated accessibility testing)

**Workflow:**

1. **Research Loop** - Single prompt:

   ```
   "Analyze Figma designs at [URL] for accessibility requirements and find
   GitHub issues labeled 'accessibility' in customer-portal repo.
   Categorize the issues."
   ```

   â†’ Copilot accesses Figma specs and GitHub issues, organizes findings

2. **Planning Loop** - Single prompt:

   ```
   "Create implementation plan for highest priority accessibility issues
   for immediate PR. Suggest follow-up issues for remaining work.
   Don't make changes yet."
   ```

   â†’ Copilot generates prioritized plan with color contrast fixes, keyboard navigation, etc.

3. **Implementation Loop** - Single prompt:

   ```
   "Create new branch and implement top 3 priority fixes from your plan.
   Create PR with issue references."
   ```

   â†’ Copilot creates branch, makes code changes, opens PR linking fixed issues

4. **Testing Loop** - Single prompt:

   ```
   "Create focused accessibility tests for updated components using
   Playwright MCP."
   ```

   â†’ Copilot writes and runs contrast ratio tests, keyboard navigation tests

5. **Issue Management** - Single prompt:
   ```
   "Update fixed GitHub issues with summary comments and create
   follow-up issues for remaining work."
   ```
   â†’ Copilot adds detailed comments to closed issues, creates new issues

**Result:** Complete accessibility improvement workflow from research to deployment with minimal manual intervention.

## Pro Tips for Maximum Productivity

### General Best Practices

- **Write descriptive comments first**: Copilot uses comments as context to generate better code suggestions.
- **Use meaningful variable names**: Clear naming helps Copilot understand your intent and provide relevant completions.
- **Leverage keyboard shortcuts**: Learn IDE-specific shortcuts for accepting suggestions (Tab), viewing alternatives (Alt+]), and triggering chat (Ctrl+I).
- **Iterate with Copilot**: If the first suggestion isn't perfect, provide feedback or rephrase your prompt for better results.
- **Combine multiple commands**: Use chat to chain requests like "Refactor this, add error handling, then write tests."
- **Set up workspace context**: Use Copilot Spaces to maintain project-specific context for more accurate suggestions.
- **Review and validate**: Always review generated code for correctness, security, and alignment with your requirements.

### MCP & Agent Mode Best Practices

**Prompting Strategies:**

- **Be specific about goals**: Clearly define what you want to accomplish and the expected output format.
- **Provide context with links**: Include relevant background and links to external resources (Figma designs, documentation) that Copilot can access via MCP.
- **Set clear boundaries**: Specify constraints like "Don't make changes yet, just create a plan" or "Only use GitHub and Figma MCP servers."
- **Request confirmations**: Ask Copilot to confirm understanding before proceeding with significant changes.
- **Use custom instructions**: Create prompt files or custom instructions to guide Copilot's behavior with specific MCP servers.
- **Phase your prompts**: Break complex tasks into research â†’ planning â†’ implementation â†’ validation phases for better control and review points.

**MCP Server Management:**

- **Choose relevant servers**: Only enable MCP servers that align with your specific workflow needs.
- **Start simple**: Begin with well-established MCP servers (GitHub, Playwright) before adding complex integrations.
- **Test connectivity**: Verify all MCP servers are properly configured and accessible before starting agent mode tasks.
- **Limit scope**: Disable unused MCP tools to help Copilot focus on relevant actions.

**Security Considerations:**

- **Use OAuth when available**: Prefer OAuth authentication over personal access tokens for services like GitHub MCP.
- **Limit permissions**: Grant MCP servers only the minimum permissions necessary for your tasks.
- **Review connections**: Regularly audit which MCP servers have access to your development environment.
- **Monitor activity**: Track what actions Copilot performs through MCP servers, especially for production systems.
